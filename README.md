# Discord Webhook Utility

I put together this little utility to scratch a specific debugging itch. It’s simple but does the job — letting you send messages, embeds, and files through a Discord webhook, plus you can even snap and send screenshots. Nothing too fancy, but it was a fun project that kept me busy and productive.

### EXE Version
Need an exe? You can run `pyinstaller` yourself — I’m too lazy.

### Requirements:
- Requests
- sv_ttk
- pygetwindow
- Pillow
